This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the `renderItem` function is called repeatedly for the same item, causing performance issues and unexpected behavior. This is often subtle and difficult to debug because the issue isn't always reproducible, and standard debugging tools may not highlight the problem immediately.  The root cause often stems from improper key usage or data mutations within the `renderItem` function that cause React to re-render more often than necessary.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myLargeDataset}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Often the source of problems
  renderItem={({ item }) => {
    // ...renderItem logic...
    // Problem: If data changes here outside of rerendering the FlatList
    // it might cause repeated rendering.
  }}
/>
```
